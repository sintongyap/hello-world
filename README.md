# hello-world
first time project on GitHub

Hi humans:

This is the first time i learn how to use github.
My current location is at usm school of chemistry because I have no wifi connection over my hostel.
And this is also my very first time be in the chemistry school. I found here is a very nice place for me to study, with their comfortable table and chair, fan , quite enrivonment and most importantly the strong wifi connection.

this is the first commit with updating statement i have made from line 6 to 8.
